4.1. You are receiving a high amount of traffic and suddenly you are getting below error. What do you do? What is your assumption about the error? What will you do to troubleshoot it?
/var/log/kern.log:Jul  6 07:10:58 Prod-Server-3 kernel: [776470.473478] Out of memory: Kill process 1596 (thread_pool.rb*) score 536 or sacrifice child.


Preffered Approach from my side will be:

1. Check for available RAM (free -h)
2. Check for inodes of file-systems (df -ikh)
3. Check for other logs in /var/log/messages or using dmesg at the same timestamp
4. Check for proper allocation of resources to VMs, I had faced similar issues when host machine (virtualbox) had allocated more RAM to VMs and to hostmachine itself no RAM was left.
5. Check If process 1596 is still running, if running get more details using ps -ef |grep 1596 for this process
